        <h1>Bristol Samba Notes</h1>
        <p>
          These are my notes about samba drumming.
          You can play the patterns as a reminder, but (a) this is
          too hard for most phones and (b) sounds awful without good
          speakers. It will only work well in recent Chrome or Firefox.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reader beware, I have almost certainly transcribed some of this wrong.
          Please tell me if you see a mistake or if you remember something I forgot.
          You can email me at <a href="mailto:tom@larkery.com">tom@larkery.com</a>.
          You can see how this works (if curious) <a href="https://github.com/larkery/samba/">here</a>.

        <h1>Instruments</h1>
        In Samba we have seen seven instruments so far:
        <dl>
          <dd>The caixa / snare</dd>
          <dt>A high-pitched two skinned drum with rattles that
            add some noise <span id="caixa-sound"></span>
            .
          </dt>
          <dd>The repinique</dd>
          <dt>A slightly lower pitched two skinned drum played
            with nylon beaters which makes a ringing sound
            <span id="repi-sound"></span>.
          </dt>
          <dd>The 1st and 2nd Surdo</dd>
          <dt>Two large bass drums which are sometimes called <em>fundos</em> because
            they go at the back. The 1st has the lowest note <span id="s1-sound"></span>, and the second a bit higher <span id="s2-sound"></span>.
          </dt>
          <dd>The 3rd and 4th Surdo</dd>
          <dt>Two smaller bass drums, again in increasing order
            of pitch. The 3rds <span id="s3-sound"></span> often seem to play rolls, and
            the 4ths <span id="s4-sound"></span> patterns with off-beats in.
          </dt>
          <dd>Agogo bells</dd>
          <dt>
            These are handbells played with a stick. One bell is tuned a bit higher than the other.
            Here I've said that the high bell
            <span id="agogo-high"></span>
            is on the accents and the low bell
            <span id="agogo-low"></span>
            the normal notes.
          </dt>

        <h1>Patterns &amp; Breaks</h1>
        <p>
          The music we have played so far is made of patterns of rhythm,
          grouped into pieces like <em>Samba Reggae</em>.
          Within a piece each drum has its own set of patterns
          which are given numbers. The leader indicates which pattern to play
          by making a circle with their thumb and forefinger (üëå), and then
          showing a number of fingers (üñê).
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the pattern, time is divided into <em>beats</em>.
          Most of the patterns we've learned so far are 1,2,4 or 8 beats long,
          after which they repeat themselves. When keeping a constant <em>tempo</em>
          all the beats are the same length in time. A faster tempo means shorter
          beats (so you can fit more into the same time).
        </p>
        <p>
          Each beat is chopped up into equal intervals where notes lie.
          Often there are four of these, called <em>sixteenths</em>,
          but in some patterns we also play <em>triplets</em> where a note is
          a third of a beat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the notes in a beat have a name - the first sixteenth is the
          <em>on-beat</em>, and the third is the <em>off-beat</em>.
          Maybe the others have names too?
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's a picture of a pattern which has a note on each beat, and accents
          on the first and third beats.
        </p>
        <div id="example-pattern"><div class="spinner" ></div></div>
        <p>
          The vertical lines divide the beats. Silent notes (rests) are
          dashes, normal notes are dots, and accented notes are <b>!</b>.
          If you click on the 2 it will switch to another pattern. Pressing CUE should
          play the pattern shown, and if you switch pattern and CUE again, the new
          pattern will come in on beat 1.
        </p>
        <h2>Breaks</h2>
        <p>
          Each piece also has a set of <em>breaks</em>. These all seem to work
          a bit differently. The leader indicates a break by making a capital T-shape
          with their forearms and then a number with their fingers (except for one break
          which just seems to be sticks-held-sideways).
        </p>
        <p>
          Some breaks are a call-and-response between the leader (or some of the drums) and
          other drums.

          Others are like a normal pattern, which plays in a loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          When going <em>into</em> a break, it seems like we usually play a final beat number one
          before starting the break.
          When <em>leaving</em> a break, it seems like the break often includes a beat one
          which is absorbed by the pattern we are returning to. I have left these out.
        </p>

        <h1>Samba Reggae</h1>

        <p>
          Samba Reggae is the first piece we learned. It's
          to a count of four, and the smallest notes are sixteenths.
        </p>

        <h1>Samba Funk</h1>
        <p>
          Samba Funk is the second piece we learned. It's to a count of four, in sixteenths.
          It sounds 'swung', with a lot of notes on the off-beat.
        </p>
        <p>
          The leader indicates it by making a cross with their beaters or arms (‚ùå).

        <h1>Six-Eight</h1>
        <p>
          This is the third piece we learned. As far as I can tell it's still actually in four,
          but also all the notes are triplets rather than sixteenths. This means that repeating
          patterns end up swapping hands unless you have 1 or 3 hands.

        <h1>Aforch√©</h1>
        <p>
          This is the fourth piece we learned. It uses agogo bells.
          All the surdo play the same pattern, which I've put in as S3 here.
          In the surdo patterns, some of the rests are actually taps on the drum with hands
          but I haven't programmed them in yet.
