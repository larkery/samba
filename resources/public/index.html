      <h1>Bristol Samba Notes</h1>
      <p>
        This page contains Tom's notes about Samba drumming.
        It can also play the patterns as a reminder. The drums
        are synthesised rather than recorded, so they sound a
        bit off. The low-frequency component of the surdos
        gets lost without good speakers or headphones.

      <h1>Instruments</h1>
      In Samba we have seen seven instruments so far:
      <dl>
        <dd>The caixa / snare</dd>
        <dt>A high-pitched two skinned drum with rattles that
          add some noise <span id="caixa-sound"></span>
          .
        </dt>
        <dd>The repinique</dd>
        <dt>A slightly lower pitched two skinned drum played
          with nylon beaters which makes a ringing sound
          <span id="repi-sound"></span>.
        </dt>
        <dd>The 1st and 2nd Surdo</dd>
        <dt>Two large bass drums which are sometimes called <em>fundos</em> because
          they go at the back. The 1st has the lowest note <span id="s1-sound"></span>, and the second a bit higher <span id="s2-sound"></span>.
        </dt>
        <dd>The 3rd and 4th Surdo</dd>
        <dt>Two smaller bass drums, again in increasing order
          of pitch. The 3rds <span id="s3-sound"></span> often seem to play rolls, and
          the 4ths <span id="s4-sound"></span> patterns with off-beats in.
        </dt>
        <dd>Agogo bells</dd>
        <dt>
          These are handbells played with a stick. One bell is tuned a bit higher than the other.
          Here I've said that the high bell
          <span id="agogo-high"></span>
          is on the accents and the low bell
          <span id="agogo-low"></span>
          the normal notes.
        </dt>

      <h1>Patterns &amp; Breaks</h1>
      <p>
        The music we have played so far is made of patterns of rhythm,
        grouped into families like <em>Samba Reggae</em>.
        Within a family each drum has its own set of patterns
        which are given numbers. The leader indicates which pattern to play
        by making a circle with their thumb and forefinger (👌), and then
        showing a number of fingers (🖐).
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the pattern, time is divided into <em>beats</em>.
        Most of the patterns we've learned so far are 1,2,4 or 8 beats long,
        after which they repeat themselves. When keeping a constant <em>tempo</em>
        all the beats are the same length in time. A faster tempo means shorter
        beats (so you can fit more into the same time).
      </p>
      <p>
        Each beat is chopped up into equal intervals where notes lie.
        Often there are four of these, called <em>sixteenths</em>,
        but in some patterns we also play <em>triplets</em> where a note is
        a third of a beat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the notes in a beat have a name - the first sixteenth is the
        <em>on-beat</em>, and the third is the <em>off-beat</em>.
        Maybe the others have names too?
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's a picture of a pattern which has a note on each beat, and accents
        on the first and third beats.
      </p>
      <div id="example-pattern">Wait a moment :)</div>
      <p>
        The vertical lines divide the beats. Silent notes (rests) are
        dashes, normal notes are dots, and accented notes are <b>!</b>.
        To show the pattern repeats at beat 2, beats 3 and 4 are grey. If you
        click on the 2 it will switch to another pattern.
      </p>
      <h2>Breaks</h2>
      <p>
        Each family also has a set of <em>breaks</em>. These all seem to work
        a bit differently. The leader indicates a break by making a capital T-shape
        with their forearms and then a number with their fingers (except for one break
        which just seems to be sticks-held-sideways).
      </p>
      <p>
        Some breaks are a call-and-response between the leader (or some of the drums) and
        other drums.

        Others are like a normal pattern, which plays in a loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        When going <em>into</em> a break, it seems like we usually play a final beat number one
        before starting the break.
      </p>
      <p>
        When <em>leaving</em> a break, it seems like the break often includes a beat one
        which is absorbed by the pattern we are returning to.
      </p>

      <h1>Samba Reggae</h1>

      <p>
        Samba Reggae is the first family we learned. It's
        to a count of four, and the smallest notes are sixteenths.
      </p>

    <div class="box">
      <h1>Samba Funk</h1>
      <p>
        Samba Funk is the second family we learned. It's to a count of four, in sixteenths.
        It sounds 'swung', with a lot of notes on the off-beat.
      </p>
      <p>
        The leader indicates it by making a cross with their beaters or arms (❌).

    <div class="box">
      <h1>Six-Eight</h1>
      <p>
        This is the third family we learned. As far as I can tell it's still actually in four,
        but also all the notes are triplets rather than sixteenths. This means that repeating
        patterns end up swapping hands unless you have 1 or 3 hands.

      <h1>Aforché</h1>
      <p>
        This is the fourth family we learned. It uses agogo bells.
        All the surdo play the same pattern, which I've put in as S3 here.
        In the surdo patterns, some of the rests are actually taps on the drum with hands
        but I haven't programmed them in yet.
