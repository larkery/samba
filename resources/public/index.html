        <h1>Bristol Samba Notes</h1>
        <p>
          These are my notes about samba drumming.
          You can play the patterns as a reminder, but (a) this is
          too hard for most phones and (b) sounds awful without good
          speakers. It will only work well in recent Chrome or Firefox.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reader beware, I have almost certainly transcribed some of this wrong.
          Please tell me if you see a mistake or if you remember something I forgot.
          You can email me at <a href="mailto:tom@larkery.com">tom@larkery.com</a>.
          You can see how this works (if curious) <a href="https://github.com/larkery/samba/">here</a>.

        <h1>Instruments</h1>
        In Samba we have seen seven instruments so far:
        <dl>
          <dd>The caixa / snare</dd>
          <dt>A high-pitched two skinned drum with rattles that
            add some noise <span id="caixa-sound"></span>
            .
          </dt>
          <dd>The repinique</dd>
          <dt>A slightly lower pitched two skinned drum played
            with nylon beaters which makes a ringing sound
            <span id="repi-sound"></span>.
          </dt>
          <dd>The 1st and 2nd Surdo</dd>
          <dt>Two large bass drums which are sometimes called <em>fundos</em> because
            they go at the back. The 1st has the lowest note <span id="s1-sound"></span>, and the second a bit higher <span id="s2-sound"></span>.
          </dt>
          <dd>The 3rd and 4th Surdo</dd>
          <dt>Two smaller bass drums, again in increasing order
            of pitch. The 3rds <span id="s3-sound"></span> often seem to play rolls, and
            the 4ths <span id="s4-sound"></span> patterns with off-beats in.
          </dt>
          <dd>Agogo bells</dd>
          <dt>
            These are handbells played with a stick. One bell is tuned a bit higher than the other.
            Here I've said that the high bell
            <span id="agogo-high"></span>
            is on the accents and the low bell
            <span id="agogo-low"></span>
            the normal notes.
          </dt>

        <h1>Patterns &amp; Breaks</h1>
        <p>
          The music we have played so far is made of patterns of rhythm,
          grouped into pieces like <em>Samba Reggae</em>.
          Within a piece each drum has its own set of patterns
          which are given numbers. The leader indicates which pattern to play
          by making a circle with their thumb and forefinger (👌), and then
          showing a number of fingers (🖐).
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the pattern, time is divided into <em>beats</em>.
          Most of the patterns we've learned so far are 1,2,4 or 8 beats long,
          after which they repeat themselves. When keeping a constant <em>tempo</em>
          all the beats are the same length in time. A faster tempo means shorter
          beats (so you can fit more into the same time).
        </p>
        <p>
          Each beat is chopped up into equal intervals where notes lie.
          Often there are four of these, called <em>sixteenths</em>,
          but in some patterns we also play <em>triplets</em> where a note is
          a third of a beat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the notes in a beat have a name - the first sixteenth is the
          <em>on-beat</em>, and the third is the <em>off-beat</em>.
          Maybe the others have names too?
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's a picture of a pattern which has a note on each beat, and accents
          on the first and third beats.
        </p>
        <div id="example-pattern"><div class="spinner" ></div></div>
        <p>
          The vertical lines divide the beats. Silent notes (rests) are
          dashes, normal notes are dots, and accented notes are <b>!</b>.
          If you click on the 2 it will switch to another pattern. Pressing CUE should
          play the pattern shown, and if you switch pattern and CUE again, the new
          pattern will come in on beat 1.
        </p>
        <h2>Breaks</h2>
        <p>
          Each piece also has a set of <em>breaks</em>. These all seem to work
          a bit differently. The leader indicates a break by making a capital T-shape
          with their forearms and then a number with their fingers (except for one break
          which just seems to be sticks-held-sideways).
        </p>
        <p>
          Some breaks are a call-and-response between the leader (or some of the drums) and
          other drums.

          Others are like a normal pattern, which plays in a loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          When going <em>into</em> a break, it seems like we usually play a final beat number one
          before starting the break.
          When <em>leaving</em> a break, it seems like the break often includes a beat one
          which is absorbed by the pattern we are returning to. I have left these out.
        </p>

      <div class="box">
        <h1>Samba Reggae</h1>

        <p>
          Samba Reggae is the first piece we learned. It's
          to a count of four, and the smallest notes are sixteenths.
        </p>

        <h1>Samba Funk</h1>
        <p>
          Samba Funk is the second piece we learned. It's to a count of four, in sixteenths.
          It sounds 'swung', with a lot of notes on the off-beat.
        </p>
        <p>
          The leader indicates it by making a cross with their beaters or arms (❌).

        <h1>Six-Eight</h1>
        <p>
          This is the third piece we learned. As far as I can tell it's still actually in four,
          but also all the notes are triplets rather than sixteenths. This means that repeating
          patterns end up swapping hands unless you have 1 or 3 hands.

      <div class="box">
        <h1>Aforché</h1>
        <p>
          This is the fourth piece we learned. It uses agogo bells.
          All the surdo play the same pattern, which I've put in as S3 here.
